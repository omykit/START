# **Food Ordering App**

The **Food Ordering App** is a web-based platform that allows users to browse food menus, place orders, and manage their delivery preferences. The app uses **MySQL** as the backend database to handle user data, menu items, and orders efficiently. This application provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers looking to order food online from their favorite restaurants.

## **Key Features**:
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  
- **Browse Menu**: Users can explore different restaurants and food categories.  
- **Place Orders**: Users can add food items to their cart, place an order, and choose delivery or pickup options.  
- **Order Tracking**: View the status of active orders in real time.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Restaurant admins can manage the menu, view orders, and update order status.  
- **MySQL Database**: Efficient data management for users, food items, and order details.

## **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vanilla JS)  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  
- **Additional Tools**: Axios for HTTP requests, bcrypt for password hashing

## **Setup & Installation**:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed
